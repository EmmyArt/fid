About Jen's Kitchen

<p> The recipes listed here are ones that I have developed myself.
In some cases, I started with a recipe found in a cookbook or
magazine, but over time, I've adapted it enough to call it my
own. Bon Appetit!</p>

<p>The site also includes links to my favorite online cooking
resources. One day, I hope to include a section of restaurant
reviews</p>

<p>If you have recommendations, feel free to email me at
jen@example.com</p>
